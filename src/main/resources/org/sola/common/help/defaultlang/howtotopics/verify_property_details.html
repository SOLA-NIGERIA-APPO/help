<h1>Verify Property Details<br>
</h1>

<p>To verify the property details, use the Property tab to add a new
property or select an existing property from the list and click the
Verify button.</p><br>

 </p>


<p>If the two part identifier for the property (i.e. Parcel Number and
Upi Ward Code) exactly matches a BA Unit in the SOLA Database, the property
will be flagged as Exists. If the property also has a geospatial
definition, it will be flagged with Has Location. This feature is intended to
help verify the property information provided with a new application.</p>
<p>Note that new property records added using the screen (e.g. FIRST LAST), are
not added to the BA Unit table. This means a new property will not show as
Exists if it is added to a second application. New property records are created when the
property related service is completed and the application is approved.</p>
